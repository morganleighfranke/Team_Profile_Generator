use prototypes for creating methods below


The application must include `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` classes. The tests for these classes (in the `_tests_` directory) must ALL pass.

The first class is an `Employee` parent class with the following properties and methods:

* `name`

* `id`

* `email`

* `getName()`

* `getId()`

* `getEmail()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;returns `'Employee'`

The other three classes will extend `Employee`.

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Manager` will also have the following:

* `officeNumber`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Manager'`

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Engineer` will also have the following:

* `github`&mdash;GitHub username

* `getGithub()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Engineer'`

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Intern` will also have the following:

* `school`

* `getSchool()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Intern'`

Finally, although itâ€™s not a requirement, consider adding validation to ensure that user input is in the proper format.
